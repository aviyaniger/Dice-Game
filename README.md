# Dice-Game

The game has two players

Each turn the player can roll the dice as many times as he wishes.
Each roll will add on to his round score. Once the player "holds", his round points add to his total score 
and his turn is over.

If a 1 is rolled at any point, the player who rolled the 1 loses his round points and his turn is over.

The first player to reach 100 points is the winner.
